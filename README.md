# PSD to HTML page

This project(`home.html`) is originally from Video named “PSD to Responsive Website Tutorial ” by The Net Ninja on Youtube.

I follow him step by step, achive this project. But still have some differnces from him.

There have 3 breakpoints(using `@media` achiving): 960px, 768px, 480px.

Above 960px: all in one line.

Below 768px: two in one line.

Below 480px: one in one line & flexbox navigation menu.
